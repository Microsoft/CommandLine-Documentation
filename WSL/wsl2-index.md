# What's New in WSL 2?

WSL 2 is a new version of the architecture in WSL that changes how Linux distributions interact with Windows. WSL 2 has the primary goals of increasing file system performance and adding full system call compatibility. Each Linux distribution can run as WSL 1 or a WSL 2 and can be switched between at any time. WSL 2 is a major overhaul of the underlying architecture and uses virtualization technology and a Linux kernel to enable its new features.

WSL 2 is only available in Windows 10, Version 2004, Build 19041 or higher.
