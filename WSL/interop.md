# Windows interoperability with Linux

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is continuously improving integration between Windows and Linux.  You can:

* Run Windows tools (ie. notepad.exe) from a Linux command line (ie. Ubuntu).
* Run Linux tools (ie. grep) from a Windows command line (ie. PowerShell).
* Share environment variables between Linux and Windows. (Build 17063+)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're running Creators Update (Oct 2017, Build 16299) or Anniversary Update (Aug 2016, Build 14393), jump to the [Earlier versions of Windows 10](#earlier-versions-of-windows-10).

## Run Linux tools from a Windows command line

Run Linux binaries from the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell using `wsl <command>` (or `wsl.exe <command>`).

For example:

```powershell
C:\temp> wsl ls -la
<- contents of C:\temp ->
```

Binaries invoked in this way:

* Use the same working directory as the current CMD or PowerShell prompt.
* Run as the WSL default user.
* Have the same Windows administrative rights as the calling process and terminal.

The Linux command following `wsl` (or `wsl.exe`) is handled like any command run in WSL.  Things such as sudo, piping, and file redirection work.

Example using sudo to update your default Linux distribution:

```powershell
C:\temp> wsl sudo apt-get update
```

Your default Linux distribution user name will be listed after running this command and you will be asked for your password. After entering your password correctly, your distribution will download updates.

## Mixing Linux and Windows commands

Here are a few examples of mixing Linux and Windows commands using PowerShell.

To use the Linux command `ls -la` to list files and the PowerShell command `findstr` to filter the results for words containing "git", combine the commands:

```powershell
wsl ls -la | findstr "git"
```

To use the PowerShell command `dir` to list files and the Linux command `grep` to filter the results for words containing "git", combine the commands:

```powershell
C:\temp> dir | wsl grep git
```

To use the Linux command `ls -la` to list files and the PowerShell command `> out.txt` to print that list to a text file named "out.txt", combine the commands:

```powershell
C:\temp> wsl ls -la > out.txt
```

The commands passed into `wsl.exe` are forwarded to the WSL process without modification.  File paths must be specified in the WSL format.

To use the Linux command `ls -la` to list files in the `/proc/cpuinfo` Linux file system path, using PowerShell:

```powershell
C:\temp> wsl ls -la /proc/cpuinfo
```

To use the Linux command `ls -la` to list files in the `C:\Program Files` Windows file system path, using PowerShell:

```powershell
C:\temp> wsl ls -la "/mnt/c/Program Files"
```

## Run Windows tools from Linux

WSL can run Windows tools directly from the WSL command line using `[tool-name].exe`.  For example, `notepad.exe`.

<!-- Craig - could you help add a section with an example here to explain this scenario: "To access your Linux files using a Windows tool, use `\\wsl$\<distroName>\'` as the file path." Currently it I can just enter `notepad.exe foo.txt` and it seems to work fine, so explaining a situation where the file path is needed would be helpful. -->

Applications run this way have the following properties:

* Retain the working directory as the WSL command prompt (for the most part -- exceptions are explained below).
* Have the same permission rights as the WSL process.
* Run as the active Windows user.
* Appear in the Windows Task Manager as if directly executed from the CMD prompt.

Windows executables run in WSL are handled similarly to native Linux executables -- piping, redirects, and even backgrounding work as expected.

To run the Windows tool `ipconfig.exe`, use the Linux tool `grep` to filter the "IPv4" results, and use the Linux tool `cut` to remove the column fields, from a Linux distribution (for example, Ubuntu) enter:

```bash
ipconfig.exe | grep IPv4 | cut -d: -f2
```

Let's try an example mixing Windows and Linux commands. Open your Linux distribution (ie. Ubuntu) and create a text file: `touch foo.txt`. Now use the Linux command `ls -la` to list the direct files and their creation details, plus the Windows PowerShell tool `findstr.exe` to filter the results so only your `foo.txt` file shows in the results:

```bash
ls -la | findstr.exe foo.txt
```

Windows tools must include the file extension, match the file case, and be executable.  Non-executables including batch scripts.  CMD native commands like `dir` can be run with `cmd.exe /C` command.

For example, list the contents of your Windows files system C:\ directory, by entering:

```bash
cmd.exe /C dir
```

Or use the `ping` command to send an echo request to the microsoft.com website:

```bash
ping.exe www.microsoft.com
```

Parameters are passed to the Windows binary unmodified. As an example, the following command will open `C:\temp\foo.txt` in `notepad.exe`:

```bash
notepad.exe "C:\temp\foo.txt"
```

This will also work:

```bash
notepad.exe C:\\temp\\foo.txt
```

## Share environment variables between Windows and WSL

WSL and Windows share a special environment variable, `WSLENV`, created to bridge Windows and Linux distributions running on WSL.

Properties of `WSLENV` variable:

* It is shared; it exists in both Windows and WSL environments.
* It is a list of environment variables to share between Windows and WSL.
* It can format environment variables to work well in Windows and WSL.
* It can assist in the flow between WSL and Win32.

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to 17063, only Windows environment variable that WSL could access was `PATH` (so you could launch Win32 executables from under WSL). Starting in 17063, `WSLENV` begins being supported.
> WSLENV is case sensitive.

## WSLENV flags

There are four flags available in `WSLENV` to influence how the environment variable is translated.

`WSLENV` flags:

* `/p` - translates the path between WSL/Linux style paths and Win32 paths.
* `/l` - indicates the environment variable is a list of paths.
* `/u` - indicates that this environment variable should only be included when runningâ€¯WSL from Win32.
* `/w` - indicates that this environment variable should only be included when running Win32 from WSL.

Flags can be combined as needed.

[Read more about WSLENV](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/share-environment-vars-between-wsl-and-windows/), including FAQs and examples of setting the value of WSLENV to a concatenation of other pre-defined environment vars, each suffixed with a slash followed by flags to specify how the value should be translated and passing variables with a script. This article also includes an example for setting up a dev environment with the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), configured to share a GOPATH between WSL and Win32.

## Disable interoperability

Users may disable the ability to run Windows tools for a single WSL session by running the following command as root:

```bash
echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
```

To re-enable Windows binaries, exit all WSL sessions and re-run bash.exe or run the following command as root:

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
```

Disabling interop will not persist between WSL sessions -- interop will be enabled again when a new session is launched.

## Earlier versions of Windows 10

There are several differences for the interoperability commands on earlier Windows 10 versions. If you're running a Creators Update (Oct 2017, Build 16299), or Anniversary Update (Aug 2016, Build 14393) version of Windows 10, we recommend you [update to the latest Windows version](ms-settings:windowsupdate), but if that's not possible, we have outlined some of the interop differences below.

Summary:

* `bash.exe` has been replaced with `wsl.exe`.
* `-c` option for running a single command isn't needed with `wsl.exe`.
* Windows path is included in the WSL `$PATH`.
* The process for disabling interop is unchanged.

Linux commands can be run from the Windows Command Prompt or from PowerShell, but for early Windows versions, you man need to use the `bash` command. For example:

```powershell
C:\temp> bash -c "ls -la"
```

Things such as input, piping, and file redirection work as expected.

The WSL commands passed into `bash -c` are forwarded to the WSL process without modification.  File paths must be specified in the WSL format and care must be taken to escape relevant characters. Example:

```console
C:\temp> bash -c "ls -la /proc/cpuinfo"
```

Or...

```powershell
C:\temp> bash -c "ls -la \"/mnt/c/Program Files\""
```

When calling a Windows tool from a WSL distribution in an earlier version of Windows 10, you will need to specify the directory path. For example, from your WSL command line, enter:

```bash
/mnt/c/Windows/System32/notepad.exe
```

In WSL, these executables are handled similar to native Linux executables.  This means adding directories to the Linux path and piping between commands works as expected.  For example:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/mnt/c/Windows/System32
```
Or

```bash
ipconfig.exe | grep IPv4 | cut -d: -f2
```

The Windows binary must include the file extension, match the file case, and be executable.  Non-executables including batch scripts and command like `dir` can be run with `/mnt/c/Windows/System32/cmd.exe /C` command. For example:

```bash
/mnt/c/Windows/System32/cmd.exe /C dir
```
