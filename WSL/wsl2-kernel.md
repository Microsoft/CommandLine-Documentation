# Updating the WSL 2 Linux kernel

To manually update the Linux kernel inside of WSL 2, please follow these steps.

> [!NOTE] 
> If the installer can't find WSL 1, right-click the Linux kernel update installer and press "Uninstall", then rerun the installer.

## Download the Linux kernel update package

Please [download the latest WSL2 Linux kernel](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) update package for x64 machines.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using an ARM64 machine, please download the [ARM64 package](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi) instead.

## Install the Linux kernel update package

To install the Linux kernel update package:

  1. Run the update package downloaded in the previous step.

  2. You will be prompted for elevated permissions, select "yes" to approve this installation.

  3. Once the installation is complete, you are ready to begin using WSL2!

## Future plans for updating the WSL2 Linux kernel

For more information, read the article [changes to updating the WSL2 Linux kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl2-will-be-generally-available-in-windows-10-version-2004), available on the [Windows Command Line Blog](https://aka.ms/cliblog).

## Troubleshooting

### This update only applies to machines with the Windows Subsystem for Linux
To install MSI kernel, WSL is required and should be enabled first. If it fails, it you will see the message:
`This update only applies to machines with the Windows Subsystem for Linux`. 

There are three possible reason you see this message:

1. You are still running an old version of Windows which doesn't support WSL 2. Please check the [WSL 2 requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10#update-to-wsl-2) and upgrade to use WSL 2. 
2. `Windows Subsystem for Linux` is not enabled. Please follow the [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10).
3. After `Windows Subsystem for Linux` is enabled, a reboot is required for it to take effect. Please reboot your machine and try again.

### `WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component. For information please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel`

You may run into the above error if the kernel is missing from `%SystemRoot%\system32\lxss\tools`.

Here are some possible ways to resolve it:

1. Install the Linux kernel manually following the instructions on this page.
2. Uninstall the MSI from "Add or Remove Programs", and install it again.
